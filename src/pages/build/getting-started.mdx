# What do I Need to Start Developing on Warp?

To start developing on Warp, you'll need:

- [ ] An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), or [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to write smart contracts in solidity.

- [ ] A wallet that holds tWARP such as  [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/).

- We suggest having at least 0.01 tWARP for standard deployments on Warp.
- You can request Warp Sepolia tWARP using our [Faucets](/tools/faucets).

- [ ] We recommend using a development framework like [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
