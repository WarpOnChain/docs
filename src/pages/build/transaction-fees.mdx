# Fees on Warp 

As aOrbit Chain L3, the fee you pay for each transaction on Warp has two components: 
1. An execution fee for the chain you're on (i.e. Warp L3)
2. A security fee that helps secure the L3 by publishing L3 transactions to Ethereum (the L1)

The security fee is generally higher than the execution fee because L1 transactions tend to be more expensive. The L1 can be subject to congestion and other situations that lead to high gas fees and longer confirmation times.
