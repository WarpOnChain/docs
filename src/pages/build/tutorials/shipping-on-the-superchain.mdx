# Shipping on the Orbit Chain

You can use [Supersim](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim) to simulate the Orbit Chain and develop apps that can be used across any chain!

Supersim enables builders to:

* Experiment with apps that can be accessed from any chain
* Create tokens with **SuperchainERC20**, a fungible token standard for tokens that can be used across the Orbit Chain
* Simulate crosschain messaging
