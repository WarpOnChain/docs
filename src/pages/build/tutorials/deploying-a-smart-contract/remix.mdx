# Deploying a Smart Contract with Remix

This guide will walk you through deploying a smart contract on Warp using Remix IDE, a popular browser-based development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.

## What is Remix?

Remix IDE is a powerful, open-source tool that helps you write, compile, deploy, and debug Solidity smart contracts. It's particularly useful for beginners as it requires no setup and runs directly in your browser.

## Accessing Remix

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. You'll see the default workspace with some example contracts

## Creating Your First Contract

1. In the File Explorer (left sidebar), create a new file by clicking the "+" icon
2. Name it `InkContract.sol` and add the following code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract InkContract {
    string public greeting = "Hello, Warp!";

    function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
        greeting = _greeting;
    }
}
```

## Compiling Your Contract

1. Click on the `Solidity Compiler` tab in the left sidebar (icon looks like an "S")
2. Make sure the compiler version matches your pragma statement (0.8.19)
3. Click `Compile InkContract.sol`
4. Look for a green checkmark indicating successful compilation

## Connecting to Warp Network

1. On the left sidebar, click the `Deploy & run transactions` tab (represented by a deployment arrow icon ▶️)
2. In the `ENVIRONMENT` dropdown:
   - If you see `Injected Provider`, select it
   - If not visible, click `Customize this list...` in dropdown
   - In the opened "Environment Explorer" window, under "Deploy using a Browser Extension" section, select `Injected Provider - [WALLET_NAME]`, where [WALLET_NAME] is your connected Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Rabby)
3. Configure your preferred Web3 wallet with Warp Sepolia network details:
   - Network Name: Warp Sepolia
   - RPC URL: https://rpc-gel-sepolia.inkonchain.com/
   - Chain ID: 763373
   - Currency Symbol: Warp
   - Block Explorer URL: https://explorer-sepolia.inkonchain.com/

Most modern Web3 wallets will allow you to add custom networks through their settings. Look for options like `Add Network`, `Custom RPC`, or `Networks` in your wallet's interface.

## Deploying Your Contract

1. Before deploying, ensure:

   - Your Web3 wallet is connected to Warp Sepolia network
   - You have sufficient ETH for deployment
   - Your wallet is connected to Remix IDE (accept the connection prompt if shown)

2. In the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab:

   - Select `InkContract` from the `CONTRACT` dropdown
   - Click `Deploy`
   - A popup from your wallet will appear - review and confirm the transaction

3. Once deployed, you'll see your contract appear under `Deployed Contracts` in the left lower corner of the window.

## Interacting with Your Contract

1. Under `Deployed Contracts`, expand your contract to see its functions
2. You can:
   - Read the current greeting by clicking `greeting`
   - Set a new greeting by:
     - Typing a new message in the `setGreeting` input field
     - Clicking `transact`
     - Confirming the transaction in your wallet

## Verifying Your Contract

See also the respective [tutorial](/build/tutorials/verify-smart-contract).

1. Go to [Warp Blockscout](https://explorer-sepolia.inkonchain.com)
2. Find your contract by its address
3. Click `Verify & Publish`
4. Fill in the verification details:
   - Choose `Solidity (Single file)`
   - Select the same compiler version used in Remix
   - Set optimization to 200 runs
   - Paste your contract code
   - Click `Verify & Publish`

<Callout emoji="">
  Make sure to verify whether optimization is on or off in Remix Compiler's
  Advanced Configuration as this can affect verification success.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Always test your contracts in Remix's JavaScript VM before deploying to testnet
- Use the Remix debugger to troubleshoot failed transactions
- Save your contract's address after deployment
- Keep your wallet secure and never share your private keys

## Useful Features in Remix

- **Debugger**: Helps you understand why transactions fail
- **Static Analysis**: Checks your code for common issues
- **Gas Estimation**: Shows approximate deployment costs
- **Console**: Displays transaction logs and debugging information
