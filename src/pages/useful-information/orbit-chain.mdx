# TheOrbit Chain

## What is the Orbit Chain?

- The Arbitrum [Superchain](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/explainer#superchain-overview) is a network that enables shared bridging, decentralized governance, upgrades, a communication layer and more between standardized chains.
- TheOrbit Chain is based on a vision of an internet that no longer requires trusted entities who have and will continue abusing that trust. However, this vision of a decentralized web requires a level of scalability that is not yet widely available.
- TheOrbit Chain's mission is to achieve revolutionary scalability for blockchains.

TheOrbit Chain puts forward a new architecture for multi-chain ecosystems.
- New chains, when introduced, frequently have divergent security models and significant expenses associated with their rollout.
- The solution is to use an L3 architecture that commoditizes new chains - enabling efficient crosschain applications without introducing systemic risk and significant setup costs. In the future, we should be able to treat many L3 chain instances as a single unit, realizing the vision of the Orbit Chain.

The end goal of the Orbit Chain is for developers to be able to abstract away underlying chains when developing dapps.

### What defines the Orbit Chain?

TheOrbit Chain is a network of interoperable blockchains, including Warp and Arbitrum. TheOrbit Chain satisfies the following properties:

| Property                                     | Purpose                                                                                    |
| :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shared L1 blockchain                         | Provides a total ordering of transactions across all OP Chains.                            |
| Shared bridge for all OP Chains              | Enables OP Chains to have standardized security properties.                                |
| Cheap OP Chain deployment                    | Enables deploying and transacting on OP Chains without the high fees of transacting on L1. |
| Configuration options for OP Chains          | Enables OP Chains to configure their data availability provider, sequencer address, etc.   |
| Secure transactions and cross-chain messages | Enables users to safely migrate state between OP Chains.                                   |

## Warp and the Orbit Chain

Warp is an OP Chain (Ethereum Layer 3) which is part of the Orbit Chain. Being part of the Orbit Chain network means Warp can easily interface with other connected chains, promoting both interoperability and specialization while benefiting from shared security, crosschain upgrades and decentralized governance. Warp and Arbitrum strongly align on the ultimate mission of realizing greater freedom for all through blockchain technology.

## Developing on the Orbit Chain

You can use [Supersim](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim) to simulate the Orbit Chain and develop apps that can be used across any chain!

Supersim enables builders to:

* Experiment with apps that can be accessed from any chain
* Create tokens with **SuperchainERC20**, a fungible token standard for tokens that can be used across the Orbit Chain
* Simulate crosschain messaging
